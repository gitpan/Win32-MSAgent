SYNOPSIS
        use Win32::MSAgent;
        my $agent = Win32::MSAgent->new('Genie');

        my $char = $agent->Characters('Genie');
        $char->Voice('Dutch', 'Alexander');
        $char->SoundEffectsOn(1);
        $char->Show();

        $char->MoveTo(300,300);
        sleep(5);

        foreach my $animation ($char->AnimationNames)
        {
            my $request = $char->Play($animation);
            $char->Speak($animation);
            my $i = 0;
            while (($request->Status == 2) || ($request->Status == 4))

        }

DESCRIPTION
    Win32::MSAgent allows you to use the Microsoft Agent 2.0 OLE control in
    your perl scripts. From the Microsoft Website: "With the Microsoft Agent
    set of software services, developers can easily enhance the user
    interface of their applications and Web pages with interactive
    personalities in the form of animated characters. These characters can
    move freely within the computer display, speak aloud (and by displaying
    text onscreen), and even listen for spoken voice commands."

    Since the MS Agent itself is only available on MS Windows platforms,
    this module will only work on those.

PREREQUISITES
    In order to use the MSAgent in your scripts, you need to download and
    install some components. They can all be downloaded for free from
    http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/devdownloads.htm

    1. Microsoft Agent Core Components
    2. Localized Language Components
    3. MS Agent Character files (.acs files)
    4. Text To Speech engine for your language
    5. SAPI 4.0 runtime
    Optionally you can install the Speech Recognition Engines and the Speech
    Control Panel. The Speech Recognition part of MS Agent is not supported
    in this version of Win32::MSAgent

USAGE
    There is no POD documentation on the methods and stuff yet. I will write
    this for upcoming versions. In this version the Agent control and the
    Characters object are implemented. No events are implemented yet, nor
    any of the Speech Recognition stuff. Please take the MS Agent Platform
    SDK helpfile (download from
    http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/devdownloads.htm) for documentation on
    the various methods and properties.
