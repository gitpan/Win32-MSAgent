Revision history for Perl extension Win32::MSAgent.

0.02  August 30
    - Added a lot but not all POD documentation, fixed a few minor bugs.
    - Makefile.PL now checks for MS OS and the presence of the MS Agent control
      if it fails, we won't create a Makefile. Thanks to Podmaster.
    - The tests now go and look for installed Character files instead of assuming
      that a certain character file is installed. The tests will be run using the
      first Character we find. Thanks to Briac Pilpre.
    - The Agent control is now loaded only once, when you use Win32::MSAgent, and 
      not every time you create an instance of the object. Thanks to Stefano Rodighiero.
    - Added demo.pl for some demonstration of what you can do with this module
